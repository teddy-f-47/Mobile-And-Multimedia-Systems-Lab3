## The built Android app

APK File (141.7 MB) : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yCBmAGNMoVjyeC0uPUCuOEgVNd9-RZmB/view?usp=sharing

The APK file is too large to be uploaded in a commit to Github, hence it is made available via Google Drive.

## The code

All of the code for developing the app is available in the directory lib/.

### main.dart

This is the 'root' of the app that contains code for the home page, as well as the image processing for image labelling, text recognition, and object detection.

### cameraview.dart

This is the code for the 'camera' page where the user can take a picture as an input for the app.

### constants.dart

This file contains constant variables that are re-usable across the app.

### styling.dart

This file contains constants for custom styling, also re-usable across the app.

## Dependencies

Information about dependencies can be found in the file pubspec.yaml.
